Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,
And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.
Her lips suck forth my soul, see where it flies.
Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.
Here will I dwell, for heaven is in these lips,
And all is dross that is not Helena.
I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sacked;
And I will combat with weak Menelaus,
And wear thy colours on my plumed crest,
Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,
And then return to Helen for a kiss.
O, thou art fairer than the evening air
Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars,
Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter,
When he appeared to hapless Semele,
More lovely than the monarch of the sky.
In wanton Arethusa's azur'd arms,
And none but thou shalt be my paramour. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% you can type in large amount of data below each item in the list, not just a single line.

\section{How to Deal with Equations}

This section gives you a template to deal with equations. 
% Greek alphabets can be used in equations as follows.
% Use \followed by the name of the Greek Alphabet
% Eg: \theta
$$
\epsilon + \mu = \nu \eqno{(1)}
$$
$$
\theta + \delta = \gamma \eqno{(2)}
$$
$$
x^2+y^3=z^4 \eqno{(3)}
$$
If you don't want to number your equations use the 
following syntax.
$$
\epsilon + \mu = \nu
$$
$$
\theta + \delta = \gamma 
$$
$$
x^2+y^3=z^4
$$

Some letter of that After-life to spell:
And by and by my Soul return'd to me,
And answer'd "I Myself am Heav'n and Hell:"

\section{Tables and Images}

Now let us learn how to create tables and show images in a Conference paper.   

\subsection{Creating Tables}
Copy the following code segment, if you want to have multiple tables in your article.Be sure to
rename the label every time you copy the code.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Enter the Table Name Here}
\label{table_example1}
% If you are copying this code to create multiple tables, Please Change the label name
% Eg: change \label{table_example1} to \label{table_example2} 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
Sachin & Dhoni\\
\hline
Kohli & Raina\\
\hline
% Please Enter your data in the above code.
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsection{Showing Images}
Copy the following code segment, if you want to have multiple images\cite{c1} in your article. Be sure to
rename the label every time you copy the code.
The image will be shown below this text once you uncomment the first line of code given 
below and give the path name of the image to be displayed. If the image is given in the
same folder as the Tex file, just enter the name of the image in the code given below. 
% Here \cite{c1} is used to refer to the reference item with label c1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      %\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig1.jpg}
      % Please Uncomment the above line of code      
      % Enter the name of your image instead of fig1.jpg 
      % Save the image in the same folder where you have the Tex file
      \caption{Enter Your Caption Here}
      \label{img_label1}
      % If you are copying this code to create multiple images, Please Change the label name
      % Eg: change \label{img_label1} to \label{img_label2}

I thank the Almighty God.How numerous you have made your wondrous deeds,
O Lord, our God! And in our plans for us there is none to equal you,
